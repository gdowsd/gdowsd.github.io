              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>
              Hi! My name is <strong>Gabby Dow<strong>. I lived in Dallas all through elementary school and now call St. Louis my home where I went to middle and high school. In high school, I had
              amazing opportunities to travel around the world on service and educational trips where I learned about many cultures, old and new, exploring
              different art forms, learning the history of the Bible, speaking new languages, and more. I love applying the knowledge I learn in the classroom
              into the world and into my experiences to deepen my understanding and love for learning. 
              </p>
              <p>
              I am majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity, and a minor in Mathemetics. On campus, I am a tutor and teaching 
              assistant for math and computer science classes. During the summer, I work at a summer camp as a mentor of high school and college-age staff, 
              and Director of Aquatics, designing swim lessons for elementary-age kids and managing a group of swim instructors. 
               </p>
               <p>
              Running and reading have been my recent passions. I like to read from a variety of genres but my favorites are mystery and suspense. 
              I played soccer competitively elementary through high school and still love playing with friends, but I now love getting some movement in 
              going on runs and walks too.
               </p>

              <h3>Birthday Paradox</h3>
              <p>
               The Birthday Paradox says that in a random group of 23 people, there is about a 50 percent chance that two people within that group will have the same birthday.
              </p>
              <p>
              The program simulates this Birthday Paradox phenomenon by randomly generating birthdays for groups of varying sizes (from 5 to 100, 
              in increments of 5) and running multiple trials for each of the experiments to determine how often shared birthdays occur within the group. 
              The results are displayed in a table, showing the probability of birthday matches as the group size increases. 
              </p>
              <p>
              This project was coded in Java using four different classes, each with its own purpose. The Simulator class is the main class that manages 
              the experiements. The Experiment class manages the Trials for each of the varying Experiment sizes indicated by the Simulator and keeps track 
              of the percentage of Birthday matches. The Trial class represents one Trial, generating a list of Birthdays and checking for matches within that
              list. The Birthday class creates random valid birthdays, using a consistent and controlled seed for reproducibility.
              </p>
              <p>
              Throughout this project, I learned about the importance of test-driven development. When starting with the tests, it forced me
              to think through the expected behavior of the code which ultimately made the implementation much more efficient. When I got to coding,
              I already had a solid idea of the design; the classes, attributes, and methods I needed to grasp the full picture of the project.
              Test-driven development encouraged a simple project design that made for less debugging and easy collaboration with my partner.
